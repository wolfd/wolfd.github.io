I make things that each must've seemed like a good idea at the time. Here's a few:

- [gifmachine](https://github.com/wolfd/gifmachine) a kiosk-mode webpage for posting and viewing gifs for workplace fun
- [citygen](https://github.com/wolfd/citygen) a city generator in Java that took most of my high school career to make
- [suchgive](https://github.com/wolfd/suchgive) a website the never came to fruition. The idea was to make giving to charities a competition, but you may see why that's fundamentally not a good idea
- [iwantnexus](https://github.com/wolfd/iwantnexus) a Google Chrome extension for thwarting the terrible Nexus 6 launch
- [noisy](https://github.com/wolfd/noisy) a really simple library that I use in my city generator project
